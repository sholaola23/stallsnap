# StallSnap

StallSnap builds a priced catalogue for a market trader from a stall photo and a voice note sent on WhatsApp.

## Before the event

Before the hackathon kickoff (16:00 UK, Mon 26 Oct 2026), there were design notes, an idea spike, a day-one test and early prototype code for StallSnap in a separate repo. None of that is in this repo. Everything here was written after kickoff, and the dated build log shows when.

## Status

Work in progress for the Meta Global AI Developer Hackathon 2026 (Indie track). Submissions are due Wed 4 Nov 2026, 9pm ET.

## Develop

Needs [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.4.4. Use bun, never npm.

```bash
bun install
bun run ci          # typecheck, unit tests, messy-input suite
```

The messy-input suite in `test/messy/` holds every attack QA has made on what this README promises. CI runs it on every pull request.

Secrets go in the environment, never in the repo. `.env.example` lists the names the code reads, with no values.
